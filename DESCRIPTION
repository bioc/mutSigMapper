Description: mutSigMapper aims to resolve a critical shortcoming of existing software for mutational signature analysis, namely that of finding parsimonious and biologically plausible exposures. By implementing a shot-noise-based model to generate spectral ensembles, this package addresses this gap and provides a quantitative, non-parametric assessment of statistical significance for the association between mutational signatures and observed spectra.
